Django Auth Link
====

Django Auth Link is a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
application intended to provide a secure mechanism for an authenticated
API client to initiate an authenticated browser session thereby saving
the user from having to separately authenticate the browser session.

This mechanism is perfect for providing seamless, pre-authenticated
web views in mobile applications, or for redirecting to web functionality
that may not yet be implemented in your mobile app.
